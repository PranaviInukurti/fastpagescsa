# Welcome to Pranavi's GitHub Fastpages!

#### This site was built with the help of [fastpages](https://github.com/fastai/fastpages) 
This fastpages site will be used as a blog to track my work and growth experienced throughout this year in CSA. I will show proof of work I was assigned as well as what I learned each week using a weekly post. 
I will also primarily be using Jupyter Notebooks (in VSCode) for my work.
