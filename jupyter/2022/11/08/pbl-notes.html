<ul>
<li>AWS stands for Amazon Web Services<ul>
<li>We will be using AWS for deployment of our websites later in the trimester</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Deployment is essentially the process that allows the website to be displayed in the Internet<ul>
<li>Can use many different cloud servers, as well as choose specific tools and services<ul>
<li>EC2 is a cloud computing platform that will serve our website</li>
<li>GitHub is the platform we are using to share our code on the Internet</li>

<ul>
<li>We talked about agile methodology<ul>
<li>How we can use agile methodology to create a more efficient scrum team when faced with multiple tasks (like all the takss needed to build a website)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We established the following roles for our scrum team<ul>

<li>Coming up with our idea for our website<ul>
<li>Have to make sure that it actually has a purpose and can be applied to the real world</li>
