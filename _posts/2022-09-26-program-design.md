# Program Design

## Brainwrite
* The goal of this website is to provide a platform that is convenient and reliable for students in their purchases related to school. Whether it be school merch, or even help with academics, our website aims to provide aid to all of the Del Norte school body.
* The plan is to have them log in with their student account at the start to sign in as their student profile and get the help they need through our website.
* The website will not be directly associated with our school due to the legality issues surrounding that entire situation. 

## Project Wireframe
* We used a [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/CS0iwE7Gt6u95D7o1kync0/women-in-stem?node-id=0%3A1) to brainstorm visual representations and ideas of what we wanted our website to look like. 
* We will continue to edit this Figma as the trimester goes on and we edit our plans on the visuals 

## Project Workflow
* We came up with a [workflow diagram](https://www.figma.com/file/Sksatvlq6lOdbhOv2lW9XG/wis-diagram?node-id=0%3A1) to help plan out the different pages of our website and how to attack them.
* As we come up with more and more ideas for our website, we will be editing this diagram to maintain a level of organization and planning for our project.
