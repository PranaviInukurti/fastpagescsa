# Notes

## Data Types
* In data types, there are both Primitive Types in Java and Wrapper Classes. 
* To identify if a data type is primitive or not, you must check its capitalization. 
    * Primitive types will not be capitalized (for example: int, boolean, char, byte, long) whereas Wrapper Classes will be capitalized (for example: Int, Double, Boolean, String)

## Primitive Data Input
* Uses the java scanner for console input

## Primitive Data Output
* Descriptions of the mathematical operations combine to form result of the operation.
* Primitive types usually aren't alone and will have primitive type doubles and/or wrapper class double.

## Java Objects (Code.org Key Learnings)
* can create a new object without using variables
* import the java scanner along with whatever else you need to create certain functions
* 2D array seen in java objects notebook with the color names in one column (1D), and the color codes in the other column (another 1D)
* static means its not part of the object
    * just in the class definition
* static public void main(String[] args)
    * used to drive a class
* new Menu(); 
    * contains while loop within it to restart the menu until we quit the program with the 0 input
* The extends feature in java is used to extend a class in order for the subclass (child) to inherit from the superclass (parent)
* To create a new object: specify the class name, followed by the object name, and use the keyword **new**
* use main.java
* Use constructors to initialize objects and set some object attributes
    * constructors can have as many parameters as needed


## Graphic User Interface (GUI)
* can inherit properties from another 
* color is once again being randomized
* seeing usage of frame.set, frame.add to show use of java objects
    * dot notation is the referencing of object
