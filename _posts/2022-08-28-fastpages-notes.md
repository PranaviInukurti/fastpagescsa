# Notes

## Data Types
* In data types, there are both Primitive Types in Java and Wrapper Classes. 
* To identify if a data type is primitive or not, you must check its capitalization. 
    * Primitive types will not be capitalized (for example: int, boolean, char, byte, long) whereas Wrapper Classes will be capitalized (for example: Int, Double, Boolean, String)

## Primitive Data Input
* Uses the java scanner for console input

## Primitive Data Output
* Descriptions of the mathematical operations combine to form result of the operation.
* Primitive types usually aren't alone and will have primitive type doubles and/or wrapper class double.
