            "content": "Part a . a) Write the WordMatch method scoreGuess. To determine the score to be returned, scoreGuess finds the number of times that guess occurs as a substring of secret and then multiplies that number by the square of the length of guess. Occurrences of guess may overlap within secret. Assume that the length of guess is less than or equal to the length of secret and that guess is not an empty string. . public int scoreGuess (String guess) { int count = 0 for (int i = 0; i &lt;= secret.length() - guess.length(); i++) { if (secret.substring(i, i + guess.length()).equals(guess)) { count++; } } return count * guess.length() * guess.length(); } . Part b . b) Write the WordMatch method findBetterGuess, which returns the better guess of its two String parameters, guess1 and guess2. If the scoreGuess method returns different values for guess1 and guess2, then the guess with the higher score is returned. If the scoreGuess method returns the same value for guess1 and guess2, then the alphabetically greater guess is returned. The following example shows a declaration of a WordMatch object and the outcomes of some possible calls to the scoreGuess and findBetterGuess methods. WordMatch game = new WordMatch(&quot;concatenation&quot;); . public String findBetterGuess(String guess1, String guess2) { if (scoreGuess(guess1) &gt; scoreGuess(guess2)) { return guess1; } if (scoreGuess(guess2) &gt; scoreGuess(guess1)) { return guess2; } if (guess1.compareTo(guess2) &gt; 0) { return guess1; } return guess2; } . Scoring Guidelines . Part A . compare guess to substring of secret | Uses of substring secret with correct length for comparison with guess | Loops through all necessary substrings of secret | Counts number of identified occurences of guess within secret | Calculate and returns correct final score (algorithm) | . Part B . Calls scoreGuess to get scores for guess1 and guess2 | Compares the scores | Determines which guess1 and guess2 is alphabetically greater | Returns the identified guess1 or guess2 (algorithm) | . Takeaways . Part A . We believe we would earn a 5/5, full credit, for this part because we completed all of the elements of the point guidlines. At first, we forgot the return statement, but we were able to problem solve and fix this. It was also hard to get the correct syntax down while we were working with new elements in Java | . Part B . Notes After some problem solving we believe we earned full credit. We found this part to be a little easier since it was simple if statements that we had learned previously. | .",

I learned how to set up the tools and applications needed for the entirety of this class We will be using GitHub, VSCode, and AWS for deployment | . | How to work VSCode _notebooks are called Jupyter Notebooks and have the .ipynb file ending These notebooks allow you to use both markdown and coding cells | . | _posts folder contains all of the markdown files to help with both frontend designing and the basic blogs we will use throughout the trimester These posts allow only markdown cells | . | _word is used in VSCode to save any documents to your Fastpages in GitHub | _pages folder includes both markdown files and HTML files | _images folder contains all of the downloaded images and screenshots that can then be added to your Jupyter notebooks and markdown files Can freely add or remove images from this folder | . | The index.html file contains the Fastpage&#39;s homepage frontend which you can easily customize | . | . Week 2 . Learned all about primitive types during this week notes on this added to the trimester notes | . | Writing --version in terminal allows you to see which version you installed for most of your installations | You can do a lot of different commands in your terminal in VSCode that would also work in replacement of your system terminal ls displays the list of files and subdirectories in your chosen directory | pwd prints the working directory that you are currently in | ls -al lists all of the contents in the directory including any hidden files you might have | cd takes you to the home directory | rm removes a file completely &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; Week 3 . AWS stands for Amazon Web Services We will be using AWS for deployment of our websites later in the trimester | . | Deployment is essentially the process that allows the website to be displayed in the Internet Can use many different cloud servers, as well as choose specific tools and services EC2 is a cloud computing platform that will serve our website | GitHub is the platform we are using to share our code on the Internet | Docker is a platform for developing, shipping, and running applications | DNS is the Domain Name Service allows us to choose the name for our website | . | . | I learned how to set up the basic tools and services needed for the deployment of our website | . Week 4 . We talked about agile methodology How we can use agile methodology to create a more efficient scrum team when faced with multiple tasks (like all the takss needed to build a website) | . | We established the following roles for our scrum team The scrum master acts as the leader (me) The manager of tasks and checking the efficiency of the team as a whole | Helps scrum team members who are in need of help on their specific tasks | . | DevOps role manages deployment (Madhumita) AWS deployment and managing POM files | . | Frontend developers manages our frontend (Shraddha) Writes code to edit and customize what user iteracts with on our website | . | Backend developers work more on actual database and backend code (Meena) | . | Using team repositories and the GitHub features (scrumboard, issues, etc.) to manage our individual tasks and review tickets as a team | . Week 5 . Started the process of our website for this trimester | Talked about UML or Unified Modeling Language and how UML diagrams are useful for helping us visualize our website building process and constructing new features to our website | Coming up with our idea for our website Have to make sure that it actually has a purpose and can be applied to the real world | Our idea is to have a Del Norte MarketPlace where students from Del Norte can buy and sells items related to school. | . | . Week 6 . This week we got the project approval for our website We showed off our UML diagrams, our Wireframes (prototypes of our website design), and our Brainwrites (brainstorms for our website) | . | We also spent this week working with APIs and ASCii art API or Application Programming Interface is a way for multiple computer programs to communicate with each other simultaneously RapidAPI is used to connect API&#39;s and usually uses the &quot;fetch&quot; to actually use the API off of the Internet can be really useful to quickly and efficiently add more features to our website | . | . | ASCii characters can be used to create art we created a program to convert an image into ASCii art | . | . | . Week 7 . We talked in depth are GitHub and Git Sociology GitHub and Git are social computing tools | We have and will be using both GitHub and Git often in this class | . | GitHub is essentially a cloud-based Git repository and a hosting service GitHub has many tools and features that can be used to manage the software | . | Git is within GitHub and manages files &amp; versions Git allows programmers to share code and work together on projects | . | We also talked about talked about ArrayLists and the differences between Arrays and ArrayLists | . Week 8, 9, 10 . These three weeks were spent learning the main topics that CollegeBoard focuses on for this course Our lessons were student led and included homework and hacks to keep us engaged everyday | . | We learned about writing classes, using objects, primitive types, iteration, boolean expressions, and arrays Notes on these topics were added to the trimester notes | The homework from each of these lessons were accomplished together with my scrum team in order to collaborate and help each other with concepts that we were confused about This work is in separate Jupyter Notebooks labeled by unit number | . | . | . Week 11 . This week was spent code, code, coding We were really focusing on our website and trying to get it up and ready for Night at the Museum Me and Shraddha worked on frontend code together and working to make our website look as close as possible to our wireframes despite being hosted on GitHub Fastpages | Meena and Madhumita worked together on backend code and set up our database for our listings | We all worked together to connect our separate frontend and backend code that was created on different repositories | . | We also had to worry about managing our tasks diligently, maintaining a good mindset despite our frustrations, and getting our website deployed for N@TM | . | At N@TM, we were able to enjoy the fruits of our labor We demoed our website to parents and students who were passing by | We took pictures and made memories with our website along with our classmates&#39; websites | We explored other classes trimester work after our shift ended | . | . &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; | . | .",

            "title": "Trimester 1 APCSA Notes",
            "content": ". Trimester 1 Notes . Unit 1 Primitive Types . Primitive types categorized into two types of data types Primitive data types - includes byte, short, int, long, float, double, boolean and char | Non-primitive data types - such as String, Arrays and Classes | . | There are eight primitive types A Byte (1 byte) and stores whole numbers from -128 to 127 | A short (2 bytes) and stores whole numbers from -32,768 to 32,767 | An int (4 bytes) and stores whole numbers from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647 | A long (8 bytes) and stores whole numbers from -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807 | A float (4 bytes) and stores fractional numbers which is great when storing 6 to 7 decimal digits | A double (8 bytes) and stores fractional numbers which is great when storing 15 decimal digits | A boolean (1 bit) and stores only 2 values, true or false | A char (2 bytes) and stores a single character/letter or ASCII values | . | . Unit 2 Using Objects . Java is object-oriented programming language (OOP) Everything in Java is associated with classes and objects, along with its attributes and methods. In real life, a car is an object and has attributes, like weight and color, and methods, like drive and brake. | A Class is like an object constructor, or a &quot;blueprint&quot; for creating objects. | . | To create classes, use the keyword &quot;class&quot; (usually main class is created) | In Java, an object is created from a class. We have already created the class named Main, so now we can use this to create objects. | You can also create multiple objects for one class | . Unit 3 Boolean Expressions and if Statements . Boolean is a primitive data type that can only store true or false values | Boolean can be declared with the keyword &quot;boolean&quot; | . import java.util.Scanner; public class booleanExample //define class using class keyword { public static void main(String[] args) //java main method { boolean isCorrect = true; //declare the boolean variables using boolean keyword boolean isWrong = false; if (isCorrect) { System.out.println(&quot;You are right.&quot;); } else { System.out.println(&quot;You are wrong.&quot;); } } } booleanExample.main(null); . You are right. . This can also be used to compare values and numbers. For example, using a comparison operator, like the &gt; operator, we can find out if an expression is true. This can be easily used in real life situations like the following. . int myAge = 16; // stating the two integers with their values int votingAge = 18; System.out.println(myAge &gt; votingAge); // returns false, because 16 is less than 18 . false . Unit 4 Iteration . An Iterator is an object that loops through collection | To use an Iterator in Java, you must import it from the java.util package. | To get an Iterator, the iterator() method can be used | There are three types of iterations that can be used For Loops | While Loops | Recursions | . | You can also add or remove numbers using an Iterator | . import java.util.ArrayList; import java.util.Iterator; public class Main { public static void main(String[] args) { ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt; numbers = new ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt;(); numbers.add(12); numbers.add(8); numbers.add(2); numbers.add(23); Iterator&lt;Integer&gt; it = numbers.iterator(); while(it.hasNext()) { Integer i = it.next(); if(i &lt; 10) { it.remove(); } } System.out.println(numbers); } } . Unit 5 Writing Class . There are a couple of steps to writing a class make sure to use the class keyword to create a class in the start | To create an object of Main, specify the class name, followed by the object name, and use the keyword new Constructors are used to create new objects | . | . | Instance variables are used to store any information regarding objects created in a class | Methods are used to show programs a new command they must run specific methods are used to perform specific tasks in a class | . | . Unit 6 Array . Used to store multiple values in a single variable | To declare an array, define the variable type with square brackets and insert values formatted in a comma-separated list, using curly braces | . String[] cars = {&quot;Volvo&quot;, &quot;BMW&quot;, &quot;Ford&quot;, &quot;Mazda&quot;}; . Access array elements by referring to the index number in the array. The counting for the elements starts at 0. | . System.out.println(cars[0]); . You can also change the value of a specific element using the index number | To find out how many elements an array has, use the length property | . String[] cars = {&quot;Volvo&quot;, &quot;BMW&quot;, &quot;Ford&quot;, &quot;Mazda&quot;}; System.out.println(cars.length); . Unit 7 Arraylist . The ArrayList class is a resizable array, which can be found in the java.util package | The size of an Array cannot be modified so if you want to add or remove elements to/from an array, you have to create a new one whereas for Arraylists, elements can be added and removed whenever you want The syntax for each type is also different | . | The ArrayList class has many useful methods. For example, to add elements to the ArrayList, use the add() method | . import java.util.ArrayList; public class Main { public static void main(String[] args) { ArrayList&lt;String&gt; cars = new ArrayList&lt;String&gt;(); cars.add(&quot;Volvo&quot;); cars.add(&quot;BMW&quot;); cars.add(&quot;Ford&quot;); cars.add(&quot;Mazda&quot;); System.out.println(cars); } } . To access an element in the ArrayList, use the get() method and refer to the index number | . cars.get(0); . Unit 8 2D Array . A 2D Array is the simplest form of a multidimensional array | The syntax for declaration is | . data_type[][] array_name = new data_type[x][y]; int[][] arr = new int[10][20]; . The syntax for initialization is | . array_name[row_index][column_index] = value; arr[0][0] = 1; . Elements in two-dimensional arrays are commonly referred by x[i][j] where ‘i’ is the row number and ‘j’ is the column number | To output all the elements of a 2D array, use nested for loops For this 2 for loops are needed, one to traverse the rows and another to traverse the columns | . | . Unit 9 Inheritance . Inheritance is essentially what attributes/methods the child class inherits from the parent class This can be used with the fibonacci sequence mini-lab earlier in the trimester | Is useful when you want to inherit the same attributed and methods from another class &quot;this&quot; is used when referring to the current object in the method | &quot;super&quot; is used to call any superclass method like the parent class | . | . | . Unit 10 Recursion . Recursion is used to make a function call itself and breaks complicated problems down into simple problems | Use recursion to add all of the numbers up to 10 | . public class Main { public static void main(String[] args) { int result = sum(10); System.out.println(result); } public static int sum(int k) { if (k &gt; 0) { return k + sum(k - 1); } else { return 0; } } } . When the sum() function is called, it adds parameter k to the sum of all numbers smaller than k and returns the result. When k becomes 0, the function just returns 0. Since the function does not call itself when k is 0, the program stops there and returns the result. .",

            "title": "Practice MCQ Test",
            "content": "I received a score of 35/40 on this practice multiple choice question test. This practice test was a really exciting experience and I learned a lot of how much I have learned this trimester and what I need to improve on based off of my mistakes. . Question 4 . Consider the following code segment. . int x = 7; int y = 3; if ((x &lt; 10) &amp;&amp; (y &lt; 0)) System.out.println(&quot;Value is: &quot; + x * y); else System.out.println(&quot;Value is: &quot; + x / y); . What is printed as a result of executing the code segment? . Answer . The answer option that I chose was a value of 2.3333333. However, the correct answer is the value 2. My answer option would only be correct if either x or y were a data type: double instead of data type: int or if either value was typecast as a double in the expression. Since the floating division is not used and integer division is used in the question, 7/3 is rounded down from 2.3333333 to 2. . Question 5 . Consider the following method. . public Arraylist&lt;Integer&gt; mystery(int n) { Arraylist&lt;Integer&gt; seq = new Arraylist&lt;Integer&gt;(); for (int k = 1; k &lt;= n; k++) seq.add(new Integer(k * k + 3)); return seq; } . Which of the following is printed as a result of executing the following statement? System.out.println(mystery ( 6 ) ) ; . Answer . The answer option that I chose was [3, 4, 7, 12, 19, 28, 39]. However, the correct answer is [4, 7, 12, 19, 28, 39]. I was wrong since this would only be the answer if k was initialized to 0. Since this event didn&#39;t occur in the code above, the first iteration would occur when k is 1, and so the starting value would be 4. . Question 19 . Assume that a and b have been defined and initialized as int values. The expression . ! ( ! (a != b ) &amp;&amp; (b &gt; 7) ) . is equivalent to which of the following? . Answer . The answer option I chose was (a != b ) || (b &lt; 7). However, the correct answer is (a != b ) || (b &lt;= 7). This was a silly mistake since the reasoning why I was wrong was because the opposite of &gt; is &lt;=. Therefore, the opposite of (b &gt; 7) is (b &lt;= 7). . Question 24 . Consider the following code segment. . int [] oldArray = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}; int [][] newArray = new int[3][3]; int row = 0; int col = 0; for (int value : oldArray) { newArray[row][col] = value; row++; if ((row % 3) == 0) { col++; row = 0; } } System.out.println(newArray[0][2]); . What is printed as a result of executing the code segment? . Answers . The answer option I chose is 5. However, the correct answer option is 7. My answer option is wrong since the value 5 is at newArray[1][1]. My answer option was incorrect since the for loop terminates, and then the newArray contains values { {1, 4, 7}, {2, 5, 8}, {3, 6, 9} }. Therefore, the actual value of newArray[0][2] would be 7. . Question 35 . Consider the following code segment. . int num = 2574; int result = 0; while (num &gt; 0) { result = result * 10 + num % 10; num /= 10; } System.out.println(result); . What is printed as a result of executing the code segment? . Answer . The answer option that I chose was 2574 whereas the actual correct answer option is 4752. In this question, my answer option was num&#39;s original value. But, num is continuously divided by 10 until it is 0. This means that in the fourth iteration, the result is assigned 475 * 10 + 2 % 10 = 4750 + 2 = 4752 and num is assigned 0. Therefore, the loop will terminate and then 4752 will be the correct value of num. .",

            "content": "Arrays Overview . Arrays are 10-15% of the AP CSA Exam | The four main topics that College Board wants you to know Array creation and access | Traversing arrays | Enhanced for loops for arrays | Developing algorithms using arrays | . | The overall purpose of arrays is to store multiple values in a single variable, instead of declaring separate variables for each value. | . 6.1 Array Creation and Access . Arrays are used to store one data type | Unlike Arraylists, arrays have a fixed size and cannot be changed | Arrays can be denoted using braces {} Below is an example of a simple array storing our scrum team names [Meena, Shraddha, Madhumita, Pranavi] . | To use an array you have to use the command import java.util.Arrays; . | . Making Arrays . There are two ways to make arrays . using constructors | using pre-intiliazed arrays | . dataType[] arrayName = new dataType[numberOfItems]; //Constructor int[] arraySample = {1,3,5,7,9}; //pre-initialized arrays . Accessing Elements in Arrays . You can access the elements in an array using different commands | . arrayName.Length //determine the size arrayName.length - 1 //to access the last item in the array . Hack 1 . How do we access the even numbers in arrayOne from above? . int[] arrayOne = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}; . Hack 2 . Which of the following is FALSE about arrays . A. A java array is an object | B. Length of array can be changed after creation of array | C. Numerical data types of arrays are initialized to 0 to start | . 6.2 Traversing Arrays . Traversing is accessing every value in the array | Can be done using a loop like a for loop or while loop | Below is an example - using a for loop, we can iterate through each fruit in the array of Strings and print it out | . // Here is the array we will be working with String[] myFruits = new String[] {&quot;Apple&quot;, &quot;Strawberry&quot;, &quot;Watermelon&quot;, &quot;Blueberry&quot;}; for (int i = 0; i &lt; myFruits.length; i++) { System.out.println(&quot;Fruit number &quot; + i + &quot; is &quot; + myFruits[i]); } . Can also loop through an array in reverse | . for (int i = myFruits.length - 1; i &gt;= 0 ; i--) { System.out.println(&quot;Fruit number &quot; + i + &quot; is &quot; + myFruits[i]); } . If we have a list of numbers, we could change each value in the array by a certain amount | . // Here is the array we will be working with int[] myNumbers = new int[] {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}; for (int i = 0; i &lt; myNumbers.length; i++) { // add 10 to each element in the array myNumbers[i] += 10; System.out.println(&quot;New element &quot; + i + &quot; is &quot; + myNumbers[i]); } . We can also traverse an array using a while loop | . // Here is the array we will be working with String[] myFruits = new String[] {&quot;Apple&quot;, &quot;Strawberry&quot;, &quot;Watermelon&quot;, &quot;Blueberry&quot;}; int i = 0; while (i &lt; myFruits.length) { System.out.println(&quot;Fruit number &quot; + i + &quot; is &quot; + myFruits[i]); i++; } . Bound Errors . ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException thrown, can happen when using loops to access array elements | In the example below instead of the condition being while the index is less than the length of the array, the condition is less than or equal too | This mean the loop will try to run when i = 4 (since the length of the list is 4). However since array index starts from 0, the last item in the array will have an index of 3. So, index of 4 will be out of bounds, resulting in the error. | . int i = 0; while (i &lt;= myFruits.length) { System.out.println(&quot;Fruit number &quot; + i + &quot; is &quot; + myFruits[i]); i++; } . Hack 3 . Create a function that takes in a list of integers and returns the list with the integers in ascending order. Print every element in this list | Example int[] myNumbers = new int[] {5, 3, 4, 1, 2}; | arraySorter(myNumbers); | Expected Output 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | . | . | . Hack 4 . Given the following code segment, which of the following will cause an infinite loop? Assume that temp is an int variable initialized to be greater than zero and that a is an array of integers. | . for ( int k = 0; k &lt; a.length; k++ ) { while ( a[ k ] &lt; temp ) { a[ k ] *= 2; } } . A. The values don&#39;t matter this will always cause an infinite loop. | B. Whenever a includes a value that is less than or equal to zero. | C. Whenever a has values larger then temp. | D. When all values in a are larger than temp. | E. Whenever a includes a value equal to temp. | . 6.3 Enhanced for loop for Arrays . This topic was pretty short, but essentially what you need to know is about the enhanced for loop. The enhanced for loop can be used to traverse through most data structures (i.g. arrays). However, it can only traverse in a forward direction. Usually the structure is like so . for (dataType i: arrayName) { do something with i } . Essentially, this code mentions how every element in the array (i) has to have something done to it. It&#39;s important to note that although there is access to the element i, but it isn&#39;t possible to change the value/set new values to element i. . We can use mutator methods on objects on the array to set the value of their instance variables. This is because i is a copy of the object reference, which means that i refers to the same object as the array element, so calling methods on i is the same as calling methods on the individual array elements themselves. For example . public class Student { private String name; /** Sets the name of the Student */ public void setName(String name) { this.name = name; } /** Other instance variables, methods, and constructors not shown */ } // IN ANOTHER CLASS /** Resets all students&#39; names */ public static void doubleArray(Student[] array, String defaultName) { for (Student student: array) { student.setName(defaultName); // Sets each student&#39;s name to a default name } } . Hack 5 . In this example, each loop includes an int array and a String array. Try adding another high score and another name to the arrays and se if you can get it to run. . public class ForEachDemo { public static void main(String[] args) { int[] highScores = { 10, 9, 8, 8}; String[] names = {&quot;Jamal&quot;, &quot;Emily&quot;, &quot;Destiny&quot;, &quot;Mateo&quot;}; // for each loop with an int array for (int value : highScores) { System.out.println( value ); } // for each loop with a String array for (String value : names) { System.out.println(value); // this time it&#39;s a name! } } } . Hack 6 . What code would you add to the following to output the length of each String that&#39;s returned from the below method? Choose A, B, C, or D. . . 6.4 Developing Algorithms using Arrays . Here are some algorithms that arrays can be used for (from college board standards), . Minimum and Maximum of a list of elements | Compute the sum, average, or mode of multiple elements | Determine if at least one element has a property | Access consecutive pairs of elements | Determine duplicates | . What to use when problem solving with arrays .length can be used to find the length of an array . The value at a specific index can be found with array[i], where i is the index | An element at index i can be replaced using array[i] = new element | You can iterate over an array with a for loop for(type element: array) { code here . | . Computing Sums with Arrays . See the code below for a sample algorithm of how to compute the sum of elements in an array. This could be applied to finding the mean, standard deviation, or any other algorithm that requires summation. . int[] array = {5, 1, 78}; // intialize int sum = 0; // variable to keep track of sum for (int number; array) { // iterates over each loop in the array sum += number; // the number is added to the sum } System.out.println(sum); //expected sum is 84, so 84 should be printed . Find the max . // from college board private double findMax(double[] values) { double max = values[0]; // initialize max with first element of array for(int i=1; i&lt;values.length; i++) { // starting with the second element, iterate over the rest of the array if (values[i] &gt; max) { // if the current element is greater than the max max = values[i]; // set the max equal to the greatest value until that point } } return max; } . Find the amount of even numbers. . private int findEvenNumbers(int[] values) { int evenCount = 0; // initalize count of even numbers to zero for(int value: values) { // iterate over every element of array if(value % 2 == 0) { // use modulus operator to check if value is even evenCount += 1; // increment evenCount if the value is even } } return evenCount; } . Hack 7 . Return a left-shifted array . Ex . {7,9,4} --&gt; {9,4,7} | {1,2,3} --&gt; {2,3,1} | {0,9} --&gt; {9,0} | {1} --&gt; {1} | . Hack 8 . Find the number of duplicate elements in an array. . Hack 9 . Use arrays to reverse a string. . Ex . &quot;hello &quot; --&gt; &quot;olleh &quot; | &quot;slay &quot; --&gt; &quot;yals &quot; | &quot;mom &quot; --&gt; &quot;mom &quot; | . Homework .

Project Wireframe . We used a Figma to brainstorm visual representations and ideas of what we wanted our website to look like. | We will continue to edit this Figma as the trimester goes on and we edit our plans on the visuals | . Project Workflow . We came up with a workflow diagram to help plan out the different pages of our website and how to attack them. | As we come up with more and more ideas for our website, we will be editing this diagram to maintain a level of organization and planning for our project. | .",

Fibonacci - For and While Loop (Extends) . In this display, we see how firstTerm = 0 and secondTerm = 1 initially as the first two digits in the output of the Fibonacci series. We use the for loop to print the firstTerm and secondTerm, add these two terms to compute nextTerm, and assign whatever value we got to nextTerm. We can also create a fibonacci sequence with a while loop. The program is essentially the same as the previous program. Although both programs work well, using a for loop would be better since the number of iterations from 1 to n is known. . import java.util.ArrayList; import java.util.HashMap; import java.util.stream.Stream; /* Objective will require changing to abstract class with one or more abstract methods below */ public class Fibo { String name; // name or title of method int size; // nth sequence int hashID; // counter for hashIDs in hash map ArrayList&lt;Long&gt; list; // captures current Fibonacci sequence HashMap&lt;Integer, Object&gt; hash; // captures each sequence leading to final result /* Zero parameter constructor uses Telescoping technique to allow setting of the required value nth @param: none */ public Fibo() { this(20); // telescope to avoid code duplication, using default as 20 } /* Construct the nth fibonacci number @param: nth number, the value is constrained to 92 because of overflow in a long */ public Fibo(int nth) { this.size = nth; this.list = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;(); this.hashID = 0; this.hash = new HashMap&lt;&gt;(); //initialize fibonacci and time mvc this.init(); } /* This Method should be &quot;abstract&quot; Leave method as protected, as it is only authorized to extender of the class Make new class that extends and defines init() Inside references within this class would change from this to super Repeat process using for, while, recursion */ protected void init() { this.name = &quot;Stream&quot;; Stream.iterate(new long[]{0, 1}, f -&gt; new long[]{f[1], f[0] + f[1]}) .limit(this.size) .forEach(f -&gt; this.setData(f[0]) ); } /* Number is added to fibonacci sequence, current state of &quot;list&quot; is added to hash for hashID &quot;num&quot; */ public void setData(long num) { list.add(num); hash.put(this.hashID++, list.clone()); } /* Custom Getter to return last element in fibonacci sequence */ public long getNth() { return list.get(this.size - 1); } /* Custom Getter to return last fibonacci sequence in HashMap */ public Object getNthSeq(int i) { return hash.get(i); } /* Console/Terminal supported print method */ public void print() { System.out.println(&quot;Init method = &quot; + this.name); System.out.println(&quot;fibonacci Number &quot; + this.size + &quot; = &quot; + this.getNth()); System.out.println(&quot;fibonacci List = &quot; + this.list); System.out.println(&quot;fibonacci Hashmap = &quot; + this.hash); for (int i=0 ; i&lt;this.size; i++ ) { System.out.println(&quot;fibonacci Sequence &quot; + (i+1) + &quot; = &quot; + this.getNthSeq(i)); } } /* Tester class method.

            "content": "Focus and Habits . Blog Purpose . The purpose this blog is to illustrate my passion for all things biology while also showing off all of the programming skills I have learned and will learn throughout the course of this year. Although I know what the purpose of my blog is, I still wish to maintain some goals in order to keep on task and stay organized while building this blog. Some of the goals I have for this blog are: . maintain a minimalist, but aesthetic style for the entire blog formatting | make sure to have a realistic and maintainable organization to the blog | include projects and/or news that I find interesting that are going on in the biology field | have a separate place to keep all of my CSA projects and assignments | . Psychology and the Good Life . In this video, Laura Santos talks about the affects that Covid-19 had on us as a society and how she could see the direct impacts of this based on her observations of the students she saw on campus. . Takeaways from the Video . Get Social The Covid-19 hit many people hard because it stole one of the primary sources of happiness that we humans get our behavior from; a social and communicative environment. By engaging with more and more people, we are able to find more and more happiness as well. Afterall, the best coders are the happiest coders. | . | Give Thanks In order to maintain a stable and more positive well-being, we must constantly remind ourselves about all of the things we are grateful for. Although it might seem cheesy or corny at first, stopping to consider the good things in our life brightens our mindset and relays a more positive outlook on our life in general. This also allows us to step away from frustrations (helping our problem-solving skills as well). | . | Be In The Moment Focusing on the present is always able to make us feel better since it allows us to stop worrying about being so “busy” (something that is highly encourage in America and especially in our school). Even the simple practice of sitting with our more negative emotions puts into perspective that these feelings are temporary and don’t need to have so much control over our actions and behavior. | . | Rest And Move Sleep has always been beneficial to our bodily functions, but even more so for our mental stability. In order to maintain a sense of happiness, it is important to have a healthy and consistent sleep schedule. Even eight hours of rest sets a foundation that all happy habits rely on. | . | Be Kind Studies show that we get more happiness from doing nice things for other people than to ourselves. People who are more happy with their lives usually are the ones focusing more on bettering the lives of people less fortunate than themselves. The boost in mood that we get from random acts of kindness allows us to feel better without worrying about harming anyone else. | . | .",

True, 20 is greater than 18 True, variable a is greater than variable b . Else Statement . // will always print out &quot;Good Bye&quot; since the time is 20 and 20 is always greater than 18, which means the condition is alwaysfalse int time = 20; if (time &lt; 18) { // the condition is in the parenthesis System.out.println(&quot;Good day.&quot;); // the return if the code executed is true under the condition } else { System.out.println(&quot;Good bye.&quot;); // the return if the code executed is false under the condition mentioned } . Good bye. . Else If Statement . // will always print out you won since 17 is greater than 10 and 15 int score = 17; if (score &lt; 10) { // in the parenthesis is the first condition System.out.println(&quot;You lost the game.&quot;); // what return follows if the executed code is true } else if (score &lt; 15) { // in the parenthesis is the second condition System.out.println(&quot;You might win the game.&quot;); // what return follows if the executed code is false for the first condition but true for the second condition } else { System.out.println(&quot;You won the game.&quot;); // what return follows if the executed code is false for both the first and second condition } . You won the game. . If-ElseIf Statements . The if statement is the first condition in the Java program that starts the management of the return. If this first condition in the if statement is true, the program will print out the statement coded inside it. If the condition is false, the execution moves on to the else condition and prints out the statement written inside this condition if it is true. If not, then the program repeats the process of moving on and checking the next condition until the code is executed. . int x; x=105; if (x &lt;= 10) { // condition 1 in the parenthesis System.out.println(&quot;X is less than or equal to 10, it is a pretty small number!&quot;); // if the value of x is less than or equal to 10, the system will return this statement } else if (x &lt;= 20) { // condition 2 in the parenthesis System.out.println(&quot;X is less than or equal to 20!&quot;); // if the value for x fails to meet all of the above conditions, but is less than or equal to 20, the system will print out this statement } else if (x &lt;= 30) { // condition 3 in the parenthesis System.out.println(&quot;X is less than or equal to 30!&quot;); // if the value for x fails to meet all of the above conditions, but is less than or equal to 30, the system will print out this statement } else if (x &lt;= 40) { // condition 4 in the parenthesis System.out.println(&quot;X is less than or equal to 40!&quot;); // if the value for x fails to meet all of the above conditions, but is less than or equal to 40, the system will print out this statement } else if (x &lt;= 50) { // condition 5 in the parenthesis System.out.println(&quot;X is less than or equal to 50!&quot;); // if the value for x fails to meet all of the above conditions, but is less than or equal to 50, the system will print out this statement } else if (x &lt;= 60) { // condition 6 in the parenthesis System.out.println(&quot;X is less than or equal to 60!&quot;); // if the value for x fails to meet all of the above conditions, but is less than or equal to 60, the system will print out this statement } else { // if the value for x fails to meet all of the above conditions, it returns the statement below System.out.println(&quot;X is greater than 60, it&#39;s a pretty big number!&quot;); } . X is greater than 60, it&#39;s a pretty big number! . Switch-Case Statements . In switch-case statements, it is possible to write as many cases as you want, as long as they are all relevant to the problem. Break statements and default statements are both optional; but if you include the default statement in some place besides the end of the program, you must make sure that the break statement follows right after the default statement. Variables aren&#39;t allowed in these cases so the value for a case must be literal or constant. . int day = 5; String dayString; // This is the switch statement that includes what the data type is, in this case it is int. The value written above must be of the same data type to prevent any errors in the program switch (day) { // Case case 1: // this is case value 1 dayString = &quot;It&#39;s Monday today.&quot;; // this is the statement that prints out if the day value matches case #1 value break; // this is the break statement (THIS IS OPTIONAL, but I included it) // Case case 2: // this is case value 2 dayString = &quot;It&#39;s Tuesday today.&quot;; // this is the statement that prints out if the day value matches case #2 value break; // Case case 3: // this is case value 3 dayString = &quot;It&#39;s Wednesday today.&quot;; // this is the statement that prints out if the day value matches case #3 value break; // Case case 4: // this is case value 4 dayString = &quot;It&#39;s Thursday today.&quot;; // this is the statement that prints out if the day value matches case #4 value break; // Case case 5: // this is case value 5 dayString = &quot;It&#39;s Friday today.&quot;; // this is the statement that prints out if the day value matches case #5 value break; // Case case 6: // this is case value 6 dayString = &quot;It&#39;s Saturday today.&quot;; // this is the statement that prints out if the day value matches case #6 value break; // Case case 7: // this is case value 7 dayString = &quot;It&#39;s Sunday today.&quot;; // this is the statement that prints out if the day value matches case #7 value break; // we can continue to add as many case statements as we want (I stopped since there are only 7 days of the week) but make sure the number of cases is relevant to your program // This is the default case for when the case statements don&#39;t apply default: dayString = &quot;That&#39;s not a day bro.&quot;; // this is the statement that prints out if the day value doesn&#39;t match any of the case values } System.out.println(dayString); . It&#39;s Friday today. . De Morgan&#39;s Law . This law came after the man named Augustus De Morgan who developed it in the 1800s. The law states how to determine what the code will execute when negation rules are applied. For example, if a and b are both boolean values, then: . !(a &amp;&amp; b) is equivalent to !a || !b | !(a || b) is equivalent to !a &amp;&amp; !b | . The following negation conditions will also apply under De Morgan&#39;s law: . &lt; becomes &gt;= | &quot;&gt;&quot; becomes &lt;= | == becomes != | &lt;= becomes &gt; | = becomes &lt; | != becomes == | . String state = &quot;HI&quot;; // !(a || b) is equivalent to !a &amp;&amp; !b if (!(state.equals(&quot;TX&quot;) || state.equals(&quot;HI&quot;))) { System.out.println(&quot;The state is not Texas or Hawaii&quot;); } else { System.out.println(&quot;The state is either Texas or Hawaii&quot;); } // !(a &amp;&amp; b) is equivalent to !a || !b if (!(state.equals(&quot;TX&quot;) &amp;&amp; state.equals(&quot;HI&quot;))) { System.out.println(&quot;The state is either Texas or Hawaii&quot;); } else { System.out.println(&quot;The state is not Texas or Hawaii&quot;); } . The state is either Texas or Hawaii The state is either Texas or Hawaii .",
