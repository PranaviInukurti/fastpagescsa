            "content": "If Statement . // will always print out true as the output since 20 will always be greater than 18 if (20 &gt; 18) { // condition in the parenthesis // the code that is executed if the condition is proved true (the return) System.out.println(&quot;True, 20 is greater than 18&quot;); } // if statements can also be used to test and/or compare variables int a = 20; int b = 18; if (a &gt; b) { System.out.println(&quot;True, variable a is greater than variable b&quot;); } . Else Statement . // will always print out &quot;Good Bye&quot; since the time is 20 and 20 is always greater than 18, which means the condition is alwaysfalse int time = 20; if (time &lt; 18) { // the condition is in the parenthesis System.out.println(&quot;Good day.&quot;); // the return if the code executed is true under the condition } else { System.out.println(&quot;Good bye.&quot;); // the return if the code executed is false under the condition mentioned } . Else If Statement . // will always print out you won since 17 is greater than 10 and 15 int score = 17; if (score &lt; 10) { // in the parenthesis is the first condition System.out.println(&quot;You lost the game.&quot;); // what return follows if the executed code is true } else if (score &lt; 15) { // in the parenthesis is the second condition System.out.println(&quot;You might win the game.&quot;); // what return follows if the executed code is false for the first condition but true for the second condition } else { System.out.println(&quot;You won the game.&quot;); // what return follows if the executed code is false for both the first and second condition } . If-ElseIf Statements . The if statement is the first condition in the Java program that starts the management of the return. If this first condition in the if statement is true, the program will print out the statement coded inside it. If the condition is false, the execution moves on to the else condition and prints out the statement written inside this condition if it is true. If not, then the program repeats the process of moving on and checking the next condition until the code is executed. . int x; x=105; if (x &lt;= 10) { // condition 1 in the parenthesis System.out.println(&quot;X is less than or equal to 10, it is a pretty small number!&quot;); // if the value of x is less than or equal to 10, the system will return this statement } else if (x &lt;= 20) { // condition 2 in the parenthesis System.out.println(&quot;X is less than or equal to 20!&quot;); // if the value for x fails to meet all of the above conditions, but is less than or equal to 20, the system will print out this statement } else if (x &lt;= 30) { // condition 3 in the parenthesis System.out.println(&quot;X is less than or equal to 30!&quot;); // if the value for x fails to meet all of the above conditions, but is less than or equal to 30, the system will print out this statement } else if (x &lt;= 40) { // condition 4 in the parenthesis System.out.println(&quot;X is less than or equal to 40!&quot;); // if the value for x fails to meet all of the above conditions, but is less than or equal to 40, the system will print out this statement } else if (x &lt;= 50) { // condition 5 in the parenthesis System.out.println(&quot;X is less than or equal to 50!&quot;); // if the value for x fails to meet all of the above conditions, but is less than or equal to 50, the system will print out this statement } else if (x &lt;= 60) { // condition 6 in the parenthesis System.out.println(&quot;X is less than or equal to 60!&quot;); // if the value for x fails to meet all of the above conditions, but is less than or equal to 60, the system will print out this statement } else { // if the value for x fails to meet all of the above conditions, it returns the statement below System.out.println(&quot;X is greater than 60, it&#39;s a pretty big number!&quot;); } . Switch-Case Statements . In switch-case statements, it is possible to write as many cases as you want, as long as they are all relevant to the problem. Break statements and default statements are both optional; but if you include the default statement in some place besides the end of the program, you must make sure that the break statement follows right after the default statement. Variables aren&#39;t allowed in these cases so the value for a case must be literal or constant. . int day = 5; String dayString; // This is the switch statement that includes what the data type is, in this case it is int. The value written above must be of the same data type to prevent any errors in the program switch (day) { // Case case 1: // this is case value 1 dayString = &quot;It&#39;s Monday today.&quot;; // this is the statement that prints out if the day value matches case #1 value break; // this is the break statement (THIS IS OPTIONAL, but I included it) // Case case 2: // this is case value 2 dayString = &quot;It&#39;s Tuesday today.&quot;; // this is the statement that prints out if the day value matches case #2 value break; // Case case 3: // this is case value 3 dayString = &quot;It&#39;s Wednesday today.&quot;; // this is the statement that prints out if the day value matches case #3 value break; // Case case 4: // this is case value 4 dayString = &quot;It&#39;s Thursday today.&quot;; // this is the statement that prints out if the day value matches case #4 value break; // Case case 5: // this is case value 5 dayString = &quot;It&#39;s Friday today.&quot;; // this is the statement that prints out if the day value matches case #5 value break; // Case case 6: // this is case value 6 dayString = &quot;It&#39;s Saturday today.&quot;; // this is the statement that prints out if the day value matches case #6 value break; // Case case 7: // this is case value 7 dayString = &quot;It&#39;s Sunday today.&quot;; // this is the statement that prints out if the day value matches case #7 value break; // we can continue to add as many case statements as we want (I stopped since there are only 7 days of the week) but make sure the number of cases is relevant to your program // This is the default case for when the case statements don&#39;t apply default: dayString = &quot;That&#39;s not a day bro.&quot;; // this is the statement that prints out if the day value doesn&#39;t match any of the case values } System.out.println(dayString); . It&#39;s Friday today. . De Morgan&#39;s Law . This law came after the man named Augustus De Morgan who developed it in the 1800s. The law states how to determine what the code will execute when negation rules are applied. For example, if a and b are both boolean values, then: . !(a &amp;&amp; b) is equivalent to !a || !b | !(a || b) is equivalent to !a &amp;&amp; !b | . The following negation conditions will also apply under De Morgan&#39;s law: . &lt; becomes &gt;= | &quot;&gt;&quot; becomes &lt;= | == becomes != | &lt;= becomes &gt; | = becomes &lt; | != becomes == | . String state = &quot;HI&quot;; // !(a || b) is equivalent to !a &amp;&amp; !b if (!(state.equals(&quot;TX&quot;) || state.equals(&quot;HI&quot;))) { System.out.println(&quot;The state is not Texas or Hawaii&quot;); } else { System.out.println(&quot;The state is either Texas or Hawaii&quot;); } // !(a &amp;&amp; b) is equivalent to !a || !b if (!(state.equals(&quot;TX&quot;) &amp;&amp; state.equals(&quot;HI&quot;))) { System.out.println(&quot;The state is either Texas or Hawaii&quot;); } else { System.out.println(&quot;The state is not Texas or Hawaii&quot;); } . The state is either Texas or Hawaii The state is either Texas or Hawaii .",

With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # &quot;My Title&quot; &gt; &quot;Awesome summary&quot; - toc:true- branch: master - badges: true - comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | . The title and description need to be enclosed in double quotes only if they include special characters such as a colon. More details and options for front matter can be viewed on the front matter section of the README. . Markdown Shortcuts . A #hide comment at the top of any code cell will hide both the input and output of that cell in your blog post. .

Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting .
