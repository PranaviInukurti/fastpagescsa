Whether it be school merch, or even help with academics, our website aims to provide aid to all of the Del Norte school body. | The plan is to have them log in with their student account at the start to sign in as their student profile and get the help they need through our website. | The website will not be directly associated with our school due to the legality issues surrounding that entire situation. | . Project Wireframe . We used a Figma to brainstorm visual representations and ideas of what we wanted our website to look like. | We will continue to edit this Figma as the trimester goes on and we edit our plans on the visuals | . Project Workflow . We came up with a workflow diagram to help plan out the different pages of our website and how to attack them. | As we come up with more and more ideas for our website, we will be editing this diagram to maintain a level of organization and planning for our project. | .",

Fibonacci - For and While Loop (Extends) . In this display, we see how firstTerm = 0 and secondTerm = 1 initially as the first two digits in the output of the Fibonacci series. We use the for loop to print the firstTerm and secondTerm, add these two terms to compute nextTerm, and assign whatever value we got to nextTerm. We can also create a fibonacci sequence with a while loop. The program is essentially the same as the previous program. Although both programs work well, using a for loop would be better since the number of iterations from 1 to n is known. . import java.util.ArrayList; import java.util.HashMap; import java.util.stream.Stream; /* Objective will require changing to abstract class with one or more abstract methods below */ public class Fibo { String name; // name or title of method int size; // nth sequence int hashID; // counter for hashIDs in hash map ArrayList&lt;Long&gt; list; // captures current Fibonacci sequence HashMap&lt;Integer, Object&gt; hash; // captures each sequence leading to final result /* Zero parameter constructor uses Telescoping technique to allow setting of the required value nth @param: none */ public Fibo() { this(20); // telescope to avoid code duplication, using default as 20 } /* Construct the nth fibonacci number @param: nth number, the value is constrained to 92 because of overflow in a long */ public Fibo(int nth) { this.size = nth; this.list = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;(); this.hashID = 0; this.hash = new HashMap&lt;&gt;(); //initialize fibonacci and time mvc this.init(); } /* This Method should be &quot;abstract&quot; Leave method as protected, as it is only authorized to extender of the class Make new class that extends and defines init() Inside references within this class would change from this to super Repeat process using for, while, recursion */ protected void init() { this.name = &quot;Stream&quot;; Stream.iterate(new long[]{0, 1}, f -&gt; new long[]{f[1], f[0] + f[1]}) .limit(this.size) .forEach(f -&gt; this.setData(f[0]) ); } /* Number is added to fibonacci sequence, current state of &quot;list&quot; is added to hash for hashID &quot;num&quot; */ public void setData(long num) { list.add(num); hash.put(this.hashID++, list.clone()); } /* Custom Getter to return last element in fibonacci sequence */ public long getNth() { return list.get(this.size - 1); } /* Custom Getter to return last fibonacci sequence in HashMap */ public Object getNthSeq(int i) { return hash.get(i); } /* Console/Terminal supported print method */ public void print() { System.out.println(&quot;Init method = &quot; + this.name); System.out.println(&quot;fibonacci Number &quot; + this.size + &quot; = &quot; + this.getNth()); System.out.println(&quot;fibonacci List = &quot; + this.list); System.out.println(&quot;fibonacci Hashmap = &quot; + this.hash); for (int i=0 ; i&lt;this.size; i++ ) { System.out.println(&quot;fibonacci Sequence &quot; + (i+1) + &quot; = &quot; + this.getNthSeq(i)); } } /* Tester class method.

The purpose this blog is to illustrate my passion for all things biology while also showing off all of the programming skills I have learned and will learn throughout the course of this year. Although I know what the purpose of my blog is, I still wish to maintain some goals in order to keep on task and stay organized while building this blog. Some of the goals I have for this blog are: . maintain a minimalist, but aesthetic style for the entire blog formatting | make sure to have a realistic and maintainable organization to the blog | include projects and/or news that I find interesting that are going on in the biology field | have a separate place to keep all of my CSA projects and assignments | . Psychology and the Good Life . In this video, Laura Santos talks about the affects that Covid-19 had on us as a society and how she could see the direct impacts of this based on her observations of the students she saw on campus. . Takeaways from the Video . Get Social The Covid-19 hit many people hard because it stole one of the primary sources of happiness that we humans get our behavior from; a social and communicative environment. By engaging with more and more people, we are able to find more and more happiness as well. Afterall, the best coders are the happiest coders. | . | Give Thanks In order to maintain a stable and more positive well-being, we must constantly remind ourselves about all of the things we are grateful for. Although it might seem cheesy or corny at first, stopping to consider the good things in our life brightens our mindset and relays a more positive outlook on our life in general. This also allows us to step away from frustrations (helping our problem-solving skills as well). | . | Be In The Moment Focusing on the present is always able to make us feel better since it allows us to stop worrying about being so “busy” (something that is highly encourage in America and especially in our school). Even the simple practice of sitting with our more negative emotions puts into perspective that these feelings are temporary and don’t need to have so much control over our actions and behavior. | . | Rest And Move Sleep has always been beneficial to our bodily functions, but even more so for our mental stability. In order to maintain a sense of happiness, it is important to have a healthy and consistent sleep schedule. Even eight hours of rest sets a foundation that all happy habits rely on. | . | Be Kind Studies show that we get more happiness from doing nice things for other people than to ourselves. People who are more happy with their lives usually are the ones focusing more on bettering the lives of people less fortunate than themselves. The boost in mood that we get from random acts of kindness allows us to feel better without worrying about harming anyone else. | . | .",

True, 20 is greater than 18 True, variable a is greater than variable b . Else Statement . // will always print out &quot;Good Bye&quot; since the time is 20 and 20 is always greater than 18, which means the condition is alwaysfalse int time = 20; if (time &lt; 18) { // the condition is in the parenthesis System.out.println(&quot;Good day.&quot;); // the return if the code executed is true under the condition } else { System.out.println(&quot;Good bye.&quot;); // the return if the code executed is false under the condition mentioned } .

You won the game. . If-ElseIf Statements . The if statement is the first condition in the Java program that starts the management of the return. If this first condition in the if statement is true, the program will print out the statement coded inside it. If the condition is false, the execution moves on to the else condition and prints out the statement written inside this condition if it is true. If not, then the program repeats the process of moving on and checking the next condition until the code is executed. . int x; x=105; if (x &lt;= 10) { // condition 1 in the parenthesis System.out.println(&quot;X is less than or equal to 10, it is a pretty small number!&quot;); // if the value of x is less than or equal to 10, the system will return this statement } else if (x &lt;= 20) { // condition 2 in the parenthesis System.out.println(&quot;X is less than or equal to 20!&quot;); // if the value for x fails to meet all of the above conditions, but is less than or equal to 20, the system will print out this statement } else if (x &lt;= 30) { // condition 3 in the parenthesis System.out.println(&quot;X is less than or equal to 30!&quot;); // if the value for x fails to meet all of the above conditions, but is less than or equal to 30, the system will print out this statement } else if (x &lt;= 40) { // condition 4 in the parenthesis System.out.println(&quot;X is less than or equal to 40!&quot;); // if the value for x fails to meet all of the above conditions, but is less than or equal to 40, the system will print out this statement } else if (x &lt;= 50) { // condition 5 in the parenthesis System.out.println(&quot;X is less than or equal to 50!&quot;); // if the value for x fails to meet all of the above conditions, but is less than or equal to 50, the system will print out this statement } else if (x &lt;= 60) { // condition 6 in the parenthesis System.out.println(&quot;X is less than or equal to 60!&quot;); // if the value for x fails to meet all of the above conditions, but is less than or equal to 60, the system will print out this statement } else { // if the value for x fails to meet all of the above conditions, it returns the statement below System.out.println(&quot;X is greater than 60, it&#39;s a pretty big number!&quot;); } . X is greater than 60, it&#39;s a pretty big number! . Switch-Case Statements . In switch-case statements, it is possible to write as many cases as you want, as long as they are all relevant to the problem. Break statements and default statements are both optional; but if you include the default statement in some place besides the end of the program, you must make sure that the break statement follows right after the default statement. Variables aren&#39;t allowed in these cases so the value for a case must be literal or constant. . int day = 5; String dayString; // This is the switch statement that includes what the data type is, in this case it is int. The value written above must be of the same data type to prevent any errors in the program switch (day) { // Case case 1: // this is case value 1 dayString = &quot;It&#39;s Monday today.&quot;; // this is the statement that prints out if the day value matches case #1 value break; // this is the break statement (THIS IS OPTIONAL, but I included it) // Case case 2: // this is case value 2 dayString = &quot;It&#39;s Tuesday today.&quot;; // this is the statement that prints out if the day value matches case #2 value break; // Case case 3: // this is case value 3 dayString = &quot;It&#39;s Wednesday today.&quot;; // this is the statement that prints out if the day value matches case #3 value break; // Case case 4: // this is case value 4 dayString = &quot;It&#39;s Thursday today.&quot;; // this is the statement that prints out if the day value matches case #4 value break; // Case case 5: // this is case value 5 dayString = &quot;It&#39;s Friday today.&quot;; // this is the statement that prints out if the day value matches case #5 value break; // Case case 6: // this is case value 6 dayString = &quot;It&#39;s Saturday today.&quot;; // this is the statement that prints out if the day value matches case #6 value break; // Case case 7: // this is case value 7 dayString = &quot;It&#39;s Sunday today.&quot;; // this is the statement that prints out if the day value matches case #7 value break; // we can continue to add as many case statements as we want (I stopped since there are only 7 days of the week) but make sure the number of cases is relevant to your program // This is the default case for when the case statements don&#39;t apply default: dayString = &quot;That&#39;s not a day bro.&quot;; // this is the statement that prints out if the day value doesn&#39;t match any of the case values } System.out.println(dayString); . It&#39;s Friday today. . De Morgan&#39;s Law . This law came after the man named Augustus De Morgan who developed it in the 1800s. The law states how to determine what the code will execute when negation rules are applied. For example, if a and b are both boolean values, then: . !(a &amp;&amp; b) is equivalent to !a || !b | !(a || b) is equivalent to !a &amp;&amp; !b | . The following negation conditions will also apply under De Morgan&#39;s law: . &lt; becomes &gt;= | &quot;&gt;&quot; becomes &lt;= | == becomes != | &lt;= becomes &gt; | = becomes &lt; | != becomes == | . String state = &quot;HI&quot;; // !(a || b) is equivalent to !a &amp;&amp; !b if (!(state.equals(&quot;TX&quot;) || state.equals(&quot;HI&quot;))) { System.out.println(&quot;The state is not Texas or Hawaii&quot;); } else { System.out.println(&quot;The state is either Texas or Hawaii&quot;); } // !(a &amp;&amp; b) is equivalent to !a || !b if (!(state.equals(&quot;TX&quot;) &amp;&amp; state.equals(&quot;HI&quot;))) { System.out.println(&quot;The state is either Texas or Hawaii&quot;); } else { System.out.println(&quot;The state is not Texas or Hawaii&quot;); } .

With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # &quot;My Title&quot; &gt; &quot;Awesome summary&quot; - toc:true- branch: master - badges: true - comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | . The title and description need to be enclosed in double quotes only if they include special characters such as a colon. More details and options for front matter can be viewed on the front matter section of the README. . Markdown Shortcuts . A #hide comment at the top of any code cell will hide both the input and output of that cell in your blog post. .
