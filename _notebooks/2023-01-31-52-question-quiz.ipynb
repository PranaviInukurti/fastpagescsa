Each row of arr is a one-dimensional array of int values, int[] row. The correct answer is C since two-dimensional arrays are stored as arrays of one-dimensional arrays. Line 8 is intended to assign to row, a one-dimensional array of int values, a single row of the two-dimensional array arr. The original version of line 8 attempts to assign a row of col, but col is not a two-dimensional array."

    "I chose \"str = str.substring(pos);\" as my answer which is incorrect since this statement would result in an infinite loop for any value of str containing one or more occurrences of the letter \"A\", since str, following the execution of this statement, would still include the letter \"A\". The correct answer is \"str = str.substring(pos + 1);\" since in the while loop, the variable pos is assigned the position of the first occurrence of \"A\" in str. If pos is less than zero, there are no more occurrences of \"A\" and the value of count is returned. Otherwise, the value of count is incremented and str is updated by removing the initial characters of str, up to and including the occurrence of \"A\" that was last included in count. The statement str = str.substring(pos + 1) accomplishes the update by selecting characters of str starting one character after pos."
