    "Start with some small code excercises\n",
    "- Write a Jupyter notebook code example on the following primitive types with a code example (4 to 5 lines), preference would be using array and methods like substring and random as applicable: int, double, boolean, char.\n",
    "- Now convert each of the examples to corresponding Wrapper classes, using arrays.\n",
    "- Expression of these in Class or PBL forms is an option. But the review must be easy for me to see work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Explore Teacher Code: [methodDataTypes](https://github.com/nighthawkcoders/spring_portfolio/tree/master/src/main/java/com/nighthawk/hacks/methodsDataTypes). I would like a Jupyter Notebook that goes over key concepts in Teacher code and uses background from ChatGPT and from AP Classroom.\n",
    "- Answer what are Methods and Control Structures\n",
    "- Explore AP FRQ that teaches us about Methods and Control Structures FRQ\n",
    "- Look at Diverse Arrays, Matrix in Teacher code and see if you think this is Methods and Control structures.\n",
    "- Look at Diverse Arrays,Matrix in Teacher code an see if you thing this fits Data Types.\n",
    "- Review DoNothingByValue, what is key knowledge here?\n",
    "- Review IntByReference, what is key knowledge here?\n",
    "- Review Menu code. Try, Catch, Runnable are used to control program execution. See if there is a way to get this to work in Jupyter Notebooks.\n",
    "- Define \"Method and Control Structures\". To the Teacher, the Menu Code has the most work of methodDataTypes files that is related to the \"Methods and Control Structures\" topic. Such exploration would begin by asking \"describe Java Methods and Control structures\". Are instances of MenuRow and Runnable data types, control structures? Does Driver have control structures, enumerate them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Explore AP Classroom. Look at 1 unique FRQ per team member on AP Classroom that goes over Methods and Control Structures. Provide me a Jupyter Notebook, Video, and/or Code that cover key concepts. Make this better than AP Classroom, specifically trying to get these reviews to cover key parts in under Ten minutes. This option could use your PBL project and concepts if they were tailored to Teaching.\n",
    "- Explore Testing requirements in AP Classroom Video\n",
    "- Explore AP FRQ that teaches us about Methods and Control Structures FRQ, 18:10\n",
    "- Make sure that code runs completely, complete any portion of FRQ that is undone. Complete FRQs in a Jupyter notebook with markdown description and comments is a requirement.\n",
    "- Integrate Data Types into the discussion as this is import concept when studying early materials.\n",
