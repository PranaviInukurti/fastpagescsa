    "The answer option I chose was I only. This is wrong since the given method increases each element of the array numbers by 1. Code segment I does not work as intended. It assigns num a copy of each element of numbers. When num is incremented, it does not change the corresponding value stored in numbers. Code segment II does not compile, as the variable j has not been declared. Code segment III does not work as intended, as it attempts to use num as an index rather than as a copy of a value from the array. Therefore, the correct answer is that none of the code segments will return an equivalent result."

In the body of the else clause, b1 retains the value true if num is less than -100. The statement assigns true to b2 if num is less than -100 or between 0 and 100, exclusive."

In the original method, when the condition in the if statement evaluates to true, the second condition, in the else if clause, is not evaluated. For the modified method, the first condition still evaluates to true and x is decreased by two. But now the second condition appears in an if statement, instead of in an else if clause, so the second condition is evaluated, found to be true, and x is increased by four.
